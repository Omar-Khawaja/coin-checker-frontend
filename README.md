This program is functionally pretty similar to [coin-checker-db](https://github.com/Omar-Khawaja/coin-checker-db), but how the user interacts with it is
different. Instead of making the user run the program through the command line
with flags, this program provides a web inteface where the user can type in the
name of the coin he/she wants to see the details of. The user can still select
the info level by clicking one of the appropriate radio buttons provided by
the interface.

The web server will start up locally on port 8080.
